## Configure Firewall

Set up a firewall to control incoming and outgoing network traffic. Only allow necessary ports and protocols.
You should consider to expose only ports 80 (http) and 433 (https).

Close all unused ports and services to minimize potential attack vectors.
Implement a default deny policy, only permitting essential services.

Regularly update and patch your server's operating system, software, and applications to ensure you have the latest security fixes and bug patches.
Enable automatic updates or establish a systematic update process.
